    "我在用crsp的数据来做机器学习优化投资组合，具体来说，是用财报数据结合宏观基本面和时序特征预测股票回报率并用均值方差的投资组合策略最大化投资收益。我现在有了model，为了测评它最后的收益表现到底如何，我想的是：假设一个人用了我们的模型，那么ta应该能看到历史的所有数据，那么，正确的应该是由第0年的前11个月个数据（feature），预测第12个月的数据（回报率），然后用前12个月数据预测第13个月数据，然后用前13个月预测第14个月数据……以此类推，然后基于每个月每个股票的回报率及预测的方差，都能用解线性优化的方式得到一个所有股票的最优投资权重组合，然后有了这么多个预测的月的回报率，结合当月实际的无风险利率，可以算一个Sharpe ratio，有了所有的Sharpe ratio后可以算一个平均值。你看我的研究思路有问题吗\n",
